## ✨ Key Features
* **Smart Keyboard Navigation:** Implements "Focus Shift" logic where pressing the 'Enter' key in the bill input automatically shifts focus to the tip input, optimizing the user flow.
* **Dual-Trigger Logic:** Calculations can be triggered by either clicking the "Calculate" button or pressing 'Enter' from any input field for a seamless experience.
* **Currency Formatting:** Uses JavaScript's `.toFixed(2)` method to ensure results are always displayed in a standard, professional currency format.
* **Modern Aesthetic:** Features a clean card-based UI with subtle hover effects, custom input styling, and responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
* **Custom Branding:** Integrated with a custom favicon to ensure a complete and professional look in the browser tab.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and organized input containers.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling featuring Flexbox for layout and polished input field states.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Functional programming for mathematical logic and DOM event listeners.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The core structural entry point.
* `/styles/style.css` - UI layout and custom aesthetic rules.
* `/scripts/script.js` - Calculation logic and keyboard event handling.

## 💡 What I Learned
Through this project, I improved my understanding of DOM Event Listeners, specifically how to capture `keydown` events to create a more efficient "keyboard-first" user experience.
